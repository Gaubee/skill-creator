### Installation & Setup
```bash
# npm installation
npm install {{PACKAGE_NAME}}

# yarn installation
yarn add {{PACKAGE_NAME}}

# pnpm installation
pnpm add {{PACKAGE_NAME}}
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Search Documentation Knowledge
Query {{NAME}} for information, API usage, best practices, and technical solutions:

#### Basic Search
```bash
skill-creator search-skill --pwd="{{SKILL_PATH}}" "search keywords"
```

#### Search Mode Selection
```bash
# Auto mode (default) - Intelligent search strategy selection
skill-creator search-skill --pwd="{{SKILL_PATH}}" --mode=auto "search keywords"

# ChromaDB mode - Semantic search with contextual understanding
skill-creator search-skill --pwd="{{SKILL_PATH}}" --mode=chroma "search keywords"

# Fuzzy mode - Keyword search with string fuzzy matching
skill-creator search-skill --pwd="{{SKILL_PATH}}" --mode=fuzzy "search keywords"
```

#### Search Modes Explained

**ü§ñ Auto Mode (Automatic Mode - Default)**
- **How it works**: First uses Fuzzy search for fast matching, if no satisfactory results are found, automatically switches to ChromaDB for semantic search
- **Best for**: 
  - When unsure which search method to use
  - When you want the best search balance
  - Daily quick query needs
- **Advantages**: Intelligent switching, balancing speed and accuracy, optimal user experience

**üß† ChromaDB Mode (Semantic Search)**
- **How it works**: Based on vector database and semantic models, understands query intent and context for conceptual matching
- **Best for**:
  - Conceptual queries ("how to handle state management")
  - Functional searches ("methods for data validation")
  - Complex queries requiring semantic understanding
  - Finding related technical concepts and best practices
- **Advantages**: Understands query intent, can find semantically related content with different keywords, ideal for conceptual searches
- **Features**:
  - Supports natural language queries
  - Understands synonyms and related concepts
  - Results ranked by semantic similarity
  - Requires search index building

**üîç Fuzzy Mode (Fuzzy Search)**
- **How it works**: Based on string fuzzy matching algorithms, quickly finds content containing specified keywords
- **Best for**:
  - Precise keyword searches ("useQuery", "useState")
  - API name and method lookups
  - Configuration options and parameters
  - Quick term location
- **Advantages**: Fast response, accurate keyword matching, suitable for finding specific APIs, config items, method names, etc.
- **Features**:
  - Supports partial and fuzzy matching
  - Fast search speed, no indexing required
  - Ranked by keyword similarity
  - Ideal for technical terms and code snippets

#### Practical Search Examples

**API and Method Queries** (Fuzzy mode recommended):
```bash
# Find specific API
skill-creator search-skill --pwd="{{SKILL_PATH}}" --mode=fuzzy "useQuery"

# Find configuration options
skill-creator search-skill --pwd="{{SKILL_PATH}}" --mode=fuzzy "baseURL configuration"
```

**Concept and Best Practice Queries** (ChromaDB mode recommended):
```bash
# Conceptual questions
skill-creator search-skill --pwd="{{SKILL_PATH}}" --mode=chroma "how to optimize React component performance"

# Best practices
skill-creator search-skill --pwd="{{SKILL_PATH}}" --mode=chroma "state management best practices"
```

**Daily Queries** (Using Auto mode):
```bash
# Let system choose the best search method
skill-creator search-skill --pwd="{{SKILL_PATH}}" --mode=auto "error handling"
skill-creator search-skill --pwd="{{SKILL_PATH}}" "routing configuration"  # --mode=auto is default
```

#### List Mode Display
For a simplified view of results, use list mode:
```bash
skill-creator search-skill --pwd="{{SKILL_PATH}}" --list "search keywords"
```

**Example Queries:**
- "how to create router"
- "state management best practices"
- "error handling mechanisms"
- "performance optimization techniques"
- "TypeScript integration"

### Add Custom Knowledge
When documentation lacks important information, add your own knowledge points:

```bash
skill-creator add-skill --pwd="{{SKILL_PATH}}" --title "Knowledge Title" --content "Detailed content"
```

**Content Types to Add:**
- üöÄ **Best Practices**: Real-world project experiences and optimization tips
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**: Common pitfalls and troubleshooting solutions
- üîß **Configuration Tips**: Special scenario setup methods
- üìö **Learning Resources**: Related tutorials and helpful links
- üêõ **Problem Solutions**: Common issues and step-by-step resolutions

### Update Official Documentation
Fetch and re-slice the latest official documentation:

```bash
skill-creator download-context7 --pwd="{{SKILL_PATH}}" {{CONTEXT7_ID}}
```

**Force Update (overwrite existing documentation):**
```bash
skill-creator download-context7 --pwd="{{SKILL_PATH}}" {{CONTEXT7_ID}} --force
```

### List All Content
View all available knowledge points in the skill:

```bash
skill-creator run-script list-content --pwd="{{SKILL_PATH}}"
```

### Rebuild Search Index
Manually rebuild index when search results are inaccurate:

```bash
skill-creator run-script build-index --pwd="{{SKILL_PATH}}"
```

## Documentation Structure

```
{{SKILL_PATH}}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ references/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context7/          # Official documentation slices
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user/              # User custom knowledge points
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json                # Skill configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md                   # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json               # Dependencies management
```

## Content Priority System

1. **User Content Priority**: Custom knowledge in `user/` folder has highest priority
2. **Official Documentation**: Official docs in `context7/` serve as reference base
3. **Smart Deduplication**: Automatically detect similarity when adding content
4. **Version Control**: Support documentation versioning and incremental updates

## Search Techniques

### üîç **Precise Search**
Use specific technical terminology:
- "useQuery hook usage"
- "route guard implementation"
- "async state management"

### üéØ **Scenario-Based Search**
Query based on use cases:
- "integration in React projects"
- "server-side rendering configuration"
- "mobile optimization"

### üìã **Comparative Search**
Compare different approaches:
- "useState vs useReducer"
- "client-side routing vs server-side routing"

### üîß **Problem-Oriented Search**
Describe specific problems:
- "resolve memory leak issues"
- "optimize initial loading time"
- "handle concurrent requests"
